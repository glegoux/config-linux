  # Allow to browse the Windows folders more easily, C:\ is mounted at /mnt/c in Linux side,

  ##
  # Description:
  #   Override builtin cd command to be compatible with Windows Path.
  #   It is executed each time that cd is used, you can bypass this override
  #   with 'builtin cd', and see this override implementaion with 'type cd'.
  #   For example 'cd 'C:\Users'' or 'cd C:\\Users' allows to go to '/mnt/c/Users'
  #   folder, it is important to espace Windows path with simple quote or to prepend
  #   each slash with another slash, because slash is a meta-character to escape the
  #   next character in Bash. Furthermore just note that Windows paths are not case
  #   sensitive.
  #   Usual cd commands continue working with:
  #   cd ~; cd -; cd ..; cd $HOME; cd; cd [linux_path]; cd -L [path]; ...
  # Global:
  #  Same that builtin cd command
  # Parameter:
  #  Same that builtin cd command
  # Exit Status:
  #  Same that builtin cd command
  #
  cd () {
    local wsl_folder=$(echo $@ | sed 's/\\/\//g' | sed 's/^C:/\/mnt\/c/')
    builtin cd "${wsl_folder}"
  }
  # Prevent that this function be overriden
